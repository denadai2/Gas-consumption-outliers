Gas-consumption-outliers
========================

The goal of this project is to detect "anomalies", unusual events, in energy consumption of buildings. The data are registrations of energy consumption (gas and electricity), weather conditions, occupance/use of the building. For many buildings also data arc avallable on parts of the building. The specific datathat will be used are from building of the University of Amsterdam and its sister organization, the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (Professional College). Historical weather data are available from Schiphol airport weather station.

Occupance data are extracted from calenders and the internet. The practical goal of this project is to find algorithms for reducing the consumption of fossile fuel and the CO2 production.

Steps
-------------
I tried to describe as much as possible the steps I have done.

* <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/denadai2/Gas-consumption-outliers/blob/master/3-%20Regression_NN.ipynb">Neural newtork predictions</a>

Why
-------------
We are the results so bad? What can I improve?


Other steps in progress
-------------
These are the steps I'm also trying. I tried them only for few hours. I'm reading various papers.
